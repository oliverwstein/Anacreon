The duchy is characterized by its vast, dense forests, rugged hills, and hardy people.The people of Dozel are known for their incredible strength, endurance, and prowess in battle. The duchy produces some of the finest warriors and armored knights in all of Grannvale, and their might is respected and feared throughout Jugdral. Dozel's soldiers are particularly skilled in heavy armor combat and are known for their unwavering loyalty to their lords.Dozel is ruled by House Dozel, a noble family descended from the crusader Neir, one of the Twelve Crusaders who fought against the dark god Loptous in ancient times. Neir's holy weapon, the legendary axe Helswath, is passed down through the generations of House Dozel and is a symbol of their divine lineage and unparalleled strength in battle.The duchy's dense forests and rugged terrain have also made it a haven for wild game, making hunting a popular pastime and a significant part of Dozel's culture. The people of Dozel are also known for their strong sense of honor, pride, and tradition, valuing strength and courage above all else.",
